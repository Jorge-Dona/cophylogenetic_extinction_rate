# Cophylogenetic extinction rate

This R function computes the “cophylogenetic extinction rate” (Ec), a statistic that uses data from event-based cophylogenetic analyses and might be informative to assess symbiont extinction risks.

A Shiny app that calculates Ec and confidence intervals (modified Wilson) is available here (https://jdona.shinyapps.io/extinction/).

See Doña & Johnson 2019 for more details.
